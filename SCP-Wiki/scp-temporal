**Special Containment Procedures:** a 1.6 km perimeter has been established around ███████ Island. Any person, entity, or object that crosses this threshold should be considered lost, and will be terminated upon any attempt to exit the perimeter. At least 8 armed operatives of MTF Nu-21 "Lancer" are to be stationed at the perimeter of SCP-xxx at all times, spread out equidistantly. 

**Description:** SCP-XXXX is a small island off the coast of Ukraine, measuring approximately 4.8 km in diameter. A 78-meter-tall mountain sits at the island’s center, with a cave entrance hidden behind a waterfall at its base. Approximately every █ minutes, an explosion erupts from the cave entrance.

[BEGIN LOG 17:5█]

**Redbear:** Alright control, the charges are set and the entities are within
the cave. 

**Control:** Copy. You are clear to proceed. 

**Redbear:** You heard 'em Blue 2, fire in the hole!

//*an explosion can be heard over the radio*//

**Redbear:** No signs of any response. well give it a few minutes before we head in and check it out. 

**Control:** Affirmative.

[17:57]

**Redbear:** Control this is lead, do you copy?

**Control:** Go ahead. 

**Redbear:** We are entering the cave now. 

//*pause*//
[[# n1]]
**Redbear:** Looks like everything went according to plan.. the back half of the cave is completely collapsed and it looks like the hairy fucks^^[#fn1 1]^^ all got caught in it. 

**Blue 2:** can't say I'm complaining though. Easy in, easy out. 

**Blue 3:** Woah, look at this! There's some sort of markings here behind the wall. It looks like the explosion blew a chunk open. 

**Redbear:** Control, what info do we have on this cave? it seems like there's some sort of structure
behind the rock wall that we freed up with the explosion. 

**Control:** Nothing interesting. As far as we know, its just a cave. 

**Redbear:** Control we may be experiencing some sort of electrical interference. You're beginning to 
cut out. 

**Control:** That's odd, we can read you loud and clear. 

**Redbear:** Could just be the headset then. ill have Blue 5 look--

**Blue 3:** AHH- //*static*//

**Blue 2:** What the fuck!?

**Redbear:** Control, blue 3 just got sucked into the wall!

**Redbear:** alright con-//*static*//-re set and th-//*static*//-ithin the cave.

**Control:** Come again?

**Redbear:** The wall where Blue 3 was standing.. there was a pile of rubble that exposed the wall behind it... and the pile of rubble just got sucked back into the wall and Blue 3 is gone. 

**Control:** Nu-21, exfil the island immediately. 

**Redbear:** yo-*static*-ire in the hole!

**Redbear:** wait.. no its the e-*static*

**Redbear:** Cont-*static*-e advised it so-*static*-ere's 2 of you talking. 

**Blue 5:** Control this is blue 5. I'm still on the water but I just heard another explosion. 

**Control:** Copy that blue 5, exfil immediately. 

**Blue 5:** What? but shouldn't i go back for-

**Control:** Negative Blue 5. Disable all communication equipment and exfil immediately. Any farther
communications you receive should be considered memetic. 

**Redbear:** No si-*static*-ll give it a fe-*static*-ead in and check it out. 

//*comms line terminated*//

**Addendum xxxx-2: note from Dr. Lovell:** SCP-xxxx appears to be some sort of temporal anomaly causing time to loop in on itself on the island. While this anomaly itself provides little threat to the veil, its effects can quickly compound into an uncontrollable cascade. Testing (see [#add3 Addendum xxxx-3)] has confirmed that any entity exiting SCP-XXXX’s boundary will do so repeatedly, creating an indefinite cycle of duplication. If a hostile entity, take SCP-173 for example, were to enter the island, and then exit its perimeter before the cycle's conclusion, a new instance of SCP-173 would emerge from the island every █ minutes ad nauseam. 

It is for this reason i recommend the counsel closes SCP-xxxx from all further testing indefinitely and a task force should be established to maintain a perimeter around the island. SCP-xxxx could theoretically be better contained at site-814, however the effects seem to be tied to the geographic location, as opposed to an entity or object at said location, making this impossible^^[https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/lovell-sitewide-email 2]^^.

**Addendum xxxx-3: SCP-xxxx duplication test:**
A fire pit was constructed at the northernmost edge of SCP-XXXX’s perimeter. A D-Class personnel was instructed to approach the island in a dinghy, stop 100 meters from shore, and use a T-shirt cannon to launch a shirt attached to a string onto the island. The D-Class then returned to the perimeter and handed the string to a researcher, who pulled the shirt into the fire pit, where it was incinerated. The D-Class was monitored for █ minutes.

**Results:** every █ minutes a t-shirt and approximately 5m of rope are dragged across the water, by a seemingly invisible force, up into the fire pit where they are incinerated. The D-class was unaffected. Note: this fire pit is to remain lit indefinitely. Construction of a proper incinerator has begun.
