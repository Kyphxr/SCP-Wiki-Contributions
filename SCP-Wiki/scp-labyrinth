Class: safe

special containment procedures: scp-xxx is to be kept on its designated stand at 
site 814 at all times. The stand is a 3m tall by 2 m wide piece of reinforced 
cement. SCP-xxxx is to remain bolted to this stand at all times. A hydrolic press
is mounted to the ceiling above SCP-xxxx's stand, holding it in place, with a cement 
extruder mounted behind it. 5 of these structures are assembled on the lowest floor
of site-814 the largest housing SCP-xxxx and the 4 smaller ones holding SCP-xxxx-01 
through -04 respectively. 

In the event of a failsafe trigger, the press will flatten SCP-xxxx down to a disc, before
quick dry cement is extruded over top. Once the cement has hardened, the stand is lowered 85m
into a slot in the floor, which is subsequently filled in its entirity with cement. The 
bottom floor of site 814 is subsequent filled with cement.
