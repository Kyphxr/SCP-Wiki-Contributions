Attention all site directors,
In an effort to create a more stable backup system and contingency plans,
I have begun work on Project [DATA EXPUNGED]. However, one hold up rhat i would 
like to request assistance for involves the relocation of spacial or geographic anomalies. 

Site-814 and SCP-[DATA EXPUNGED] are being constructed for the purpose of harboring 
anomalies that defy are understanding of physical space, and if we could develop a method
of moving large areas of land, we could potentially alleviate dozens of SCPs to the Safe designation.
