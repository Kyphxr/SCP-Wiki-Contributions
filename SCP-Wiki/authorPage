series.png Per the greenlighting policy, first-time authors must get concepts reviewed in the Ideas Critique Forum or IRC chatrooms before creating a feedback thread in the Drafts and Critique forum. Draft critique can still be sought via IRC and PM without greenlights.
series.png When you have a draft that you know for sure the audience will like, bring it to Drafts Critique Forum. Please note that the forums move much slower than the chat, and the draft forum moves slower than the ideas forum!
series.png The mainsite-run IRC chatrooms are the most reliable source of real-time critique discussion.
